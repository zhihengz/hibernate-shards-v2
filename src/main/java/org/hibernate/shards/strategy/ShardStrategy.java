 * Interface to specify Sharding behavior.

 * 
 *  <p>When given a query the {@link ShardAccessStrategy} will determine how the query will be distributed across 
 * the known shards - in sequence, in parallel, or some combination of the two.
 *  </p> 
 *  <p> When looking for an entity with a known Id and type {@link ShardResolutionStrategy} will return all possible shards
 * that this entity might reside on. 
 *  </p> 
 *  <p> When given an entity the {@link ShardSelectionStrategy} will determine which shard that object should be persisted
 * or updated on.
